\@writefile{lot}{\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Overview of some common graph embedding approaches, by type of embedded objects, alongside examples of their use in the prediction of species interactions. These methods have not yet been routinely used to predict species interactions; most examples that we identified were either statistical associations, or analogues to joint species distribution models. \(^a\): application is concerned with \emph  {statistical} interactions, which are not necessarilly direct biotic interactions; \(^b\):application is concerned with joint-SDM-like approach, which is also very close to statistical associations as opposed to direct biotic interactions. Given the need to evaluate different methods on a problem-specific basis, the fact that a lot of methods have not been used on network problems is an opportunity for benchmarking and method development. Note that the row for PCA also applies to kernel/probabilistic PCA, which are variations on the more general method of SVD. Note further that tSNE has been included because it is frequently used to embed graphs, including of species associations/interactions, despite not being strictly speaking, a graph embedding technique (see \emph  {e.g.} Chami et al., 2022)\relax }}{4}{table.1}\protected@file@percent }
