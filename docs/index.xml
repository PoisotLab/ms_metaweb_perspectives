<p>The ability to infer <italic>potential</italic> interactions could
serve as a significant breakthrough in our ability to conceptualize
species interaction networks over large spatial scales
(<xref alt="Hortal et al. 2015" rid="ref-Hortal2015Seven" ref-type="bibr">Hortal
et al. 2015</xref>). Reliable inferences would not only boost our
understanding of the structure of species interaction networks, but also
increase the amount of information that can be used for biodiversity
management. In a recent overview of the field of ecological network
prediction, Strydom et al.
(<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-Strydom2021Roadmap" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
identified two challenges of interest to the prediction of interactions
at large scales. First, there is a relative scarcity of relevant data in
most places globally – which, due to the limitations in most predictive
methods, restricts the ability to infer interactions to locations where
it is least required (<italic>i.e.</italic> regions where we already
have interaction data) leaving us unable to make inference in data
scarce regions (where we most need it); second, accurate predictors are
important for accurate predictions, and the lack of methods that can
leverage a small amount of <italic>accurate</italic> data is a serious
impediment to our predictive ability. In most places, our most reliable
biodiversity knowledge is that of a species pool where a set of
potentially interacting species in a given area could occur: through the
analysis of databases like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
(GBIF) or the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN),
it is possible to construct a list of species for a region of interest;
however inferring the potential interactions between these species still
remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Following the definition of Dunne
(<xref alt="2006" rid="ref-Dunne2006Network" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>),
a metaweb is the ecological network analogue to the species pool;
specifically, it inventories all <italic>potential</italic> interactions
between species for a spatially delimited area (and so captures the
<inline-formula><alternatives>
<tex-math><![CDATA[\gamma]]></tex-math>
<mml:math display="inline" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>
diversity of interactions). The metaweb itself is not a prediction of
local networks at specific locations within the spatial area it covers:
it will have a different structure, notably by having a larger
connectance (see <italic>e.g.</italic>
<xref alt="Wood et al. 2015" rid="ref-Wood2015Effects" ref-type="bibr">Wood
et al. 2015</xref>) and complexity (see <italic>e.g.</italic>
<xref alt="Galiana et al. 2022" rid="ref-Galiana2022Ecological" ref-type="bibr">Galiana
et al. 2022</xref>), than any of these local networks. These local
networks (which capture the <inline-formula><alternatives>
<tex-math><![CDATA[\alpha]]></tex-math>
<mml:math display="inline" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>
diversity of interactions) are a subset of the metaweb’s species and its
realized interactions, and have been called “metaweb realizations”
(<xref alt="Poisot, Stouffer, and Gravel 2015" rid="ref-Poisot2015Species" ref-type="bibr">Poisot,
Stouffer, and Gravel 2015</xref>). Differences between local networks
and their metawebs are due to chance, species abundance and
co-occurrence, local environmental conditions, and local distribution of
functional traits, among others. Specifically, although co-occurrence
can be driven by interactions
(<xref alt="Cazelles et al. 2016" rid="ref-Cazelles2016Theory" ref-type="bibr">Cazelles
et al. 2016</xref>), co-occurrence alone is not a predictor of
interactions
(<xref alt="Blanchet, Cazelles, and Gravel 2020" rid="ref-Blanchet2020Cooccurrence" ref-type="bibr">Blanchet,
Cazelles, and Gravel 2020</xref>;
<xref alt="Thurman et al. 2019" rid="ref-Thurman2019Testing" ref-type="bibr">Thurman
et al. 2019</xref>), and therefore the lack of co-occurrence cannot be
used to infer the lack of a feasible interaction. Yet, recent results by
Saravia et al.
(<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-Saravia2021Ecological" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
strongly suggested that local (metaweb) realizations only respond weakly
to local conditions: instead, they reflect constraints inherited by the
structure of their metaweb. This sets up the core goal of predictive
network ecology as the prediction of metaweb structure, as it is
required to accurately produce downscaled, local predictions.</p>
<p>Because the metaweb represents the joint effect of functional,
phylogenetic, and macroecological processes
(<xref alt="Morales-Castilla et al. 2015" rid="ref-Morales-Castilla2015Inferring" ref-type="bibr">Morales-Castilla
et al. 2015</xref>), it holds valuable ecological information.
Specifically, it represents the “upper bounds” on what the composition
of the local networks, given a local species pool, can be (see
<italic>e.g.</italic>
<xref alt="McLeod et al. 2021" rid="ref-McLeod2021Sampling" ref-type="bibr">McLeod
et al. 2021</xref>); this information can help evaluate the ability of
ecological assemblages to withstand the effects of, for example, climate
change
(<xref alt="Fricke et al. 2022" rid="ref-Fricke2022Effects" ref-type="bibr">Fricke
et al. 2022</xref>). These local networks may be reconstructed given an
appropriate knowledge of local species composition and provide
information on the structure of food webs at finer spatial scales. This
has been done for example for tree-galler-parasitoid systems
(<xref alt="Gravel et al. 2018" rid="ref-Gravel2018Bringing" ref-type="bibr">Gravel
et al. 2018</xref>), fish trophic interactions
(<xref alt="Albouy et al. 2019" rid="ref-Albouy2019Marine" ref-type="bibr">Albouy
et al. 2019</xref>), tetrapod trophic interactions
(<xref alt="J. Braga et al. 2019" rid="ref-Braga2019Spatial" ref-type="bibr">J.
Braga et al. 2019</xref>;
<xref alt="O’Connor et al. 2020" rid="ref-OConnor2020Unveiling" ref-type="bibr">O’Connor
et al. 2020</xref>), and crop-pest networks
(<xref alt="Grünig et al. 2020" rid="ref-Grunig2020Crop" ref-type="bibr">Grünig
et al. 2020</xref>). In this contribution, we highlight the power of
viewing (and constructing) metawebs as <italic>probabilistic</italic>
objects in the context of low-probability interactions, discuss how a
family of machine learning tools (graph embeddings and transfer
learning) can be used to overcome data limitations to metaweb inference,
and highlight how the use of metawebs introduces important questions for
the field of network ecology.</p>
<sec id="a-metaweb-is-an-inherently-probabilistic-object">
  <title>A metaweb is an inherently probabilistic object</title>
  <p>Treating interactions as probabilistic (as opposed to binary)
  events is a more nuanced and realistic way to represent them. Dallas,
  Park, and Drake
  (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-Dallas2017Predicting" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)
  suggested that most interactions (links) in ecological networks are
  cryptic, <italic>i.e.</italic> uncommon or hard to observe. This
  argument echoes Jordano
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-Jordano2016Sampling" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>):
  sampling ecological interactions is difficult because it requires
  first the joint observation of two species, and then the observation
  of their interaction. In addition, it is generally expected that weak
  or rare interactions will be more prevalent in networks than common or
  strong interactions
  (<xref alt="Csermely 2004" rid="ref-Csermely2004Strong" ref-type="bibr">Csermely
  2004</xref>), compared to strong, persistent interactions; this is
  notably the case in food chains, wherein many weaker interactions are
  key to the stability of a system
  (<xref alt="Neutel, Heesterbeek, and de Ruiter 2002" rid="ref-Neutel2002Stability" ref-type="bibr">Neutel,
  Heesterbeek, and de Ruiter 2002</xref>). In the light of these
  observations, we expect to see an over-representation of
  low-probability (hereafter rare) interactions under a model that
  accurately predicts interaction probabilities.</p>
  <p>Yet, the original metaweb definition, and indeed most past uses of
  metawebs, was based on the presence/absence of interactions. Moving
  towards <italic>probabilistic</italic> metawebs, by representing
  interactions as Bernoulli events (see <italic>e.g.</italic>
  <xref alt="Poisot et al. 2016" rid="ref-Poisot2016Structure" ref-type="bibr">Poisot
  et al. 2016</xref>), offers the opportunity to weigh these rare
  interactions appropriately. The inherent plasticity of interactions is
  important to capture: there have been documented instances of food
  webs undergoing rapid collapse/recovery cycles over short periods of
  time (<italic>e.g.</italic>
  <xref alt="Pedersen et al. 2017" rid="ref-Pedersen2017Signatures" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen
  et al. 2017</xref>). Furthermore, because the structure of the metaweb
  cannot be known in advance, it is important to rely on predictive
  tools that do not assume a specific network topology for link
  prediction
  (<xref alt="Gaucher, Klopp, and Robin 2021" rid="ref-Gaucher2021Outlier" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher,
  Klopp, and Robin 2021</xref>), but are able to work on generalizations
  of the network. These considerations emphasize why metaweb predictions
  should focus on quantitative (preferentially probabilistic)
  predictions, and this should constrain the suite of models that are
  appropriate for prediction.</p>
  <p>It is important to recall that a metaweb is intended as a catalogue
  of all potential (feasible) interactions, which is then filtered for a
  given application
  (<xref alt="Morales-Castilla et al. 2015" rid="ref-Morales-Castilla2015Inferring" ref-type="bibr">Morales-Castilla
  et al. 2015</xref>). It is therefore important to separate the
  interactions that happen “almost surely” (repeated observational
  data), “almost never” (repeated lack of evidence <italic>or</italic>
  evidence that the link is forbidden through <italic>e.g.</italic>
  trait mis-match), and interactions with a probability that lays
  somewhere in between
  (<xref alt="Catchen et al. 2023" rid="ref-Catchen2023Missing" ref-type="bibr">Catchen
  et al. 2023</xref>). In a sense, that most ecological interactions are
  elusive can call for a slightly different approach to sampling: once
  the common interactions are documented, the effort required in
  documenting each rare interaction will increase exponentially
  (<xref alt="Jordano 2016" rid="ref-Jordano2016Sampling" ref-type="bibr">Jordano
  2016</xref>). Recent proposals in other fields relying on machine
  learning approaches emphasize the idea that algorithms meant to
  predict, through the assumption that they approximate the process
  generating the data, can also act as data generators
  (<xref alt="Hoffmann et al. 2019" rid="ref-Hoffmann2019Machine" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann
  et al. 2019</xref>). High quality observational data can be used to
  infer core rules underpinning network structure, and be supplemented
  with synthetic data coming from predictive models trained on them,
  thereby increasing the volume of information available for analysis.
  Indeed, Strydom et al.
  (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-Strydom2021Roadmap" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
  suggested that knowing the metaweb may render the prediction of local
  networks easier, because it fixes an “upper bound” on which
  interactions can exist. In this context, a probabilistic metaweb
  represents an aggregation of informative priors on the biological
  feasibility of interactions, which is usually hard to obtain yet has
  possibly the most potential to boost our predictive ability of local
  networks
  (<xref alt="Bartomeus 2013" rid="ref-Bartomeus2013Understanding" ref-type="bibr">Bartomeus

  <xref alt="Bartomeus et al. 2016" rid="ref-Bartomeus2016Common" ref-type="bibr">Bartomeus
  et al. 2016</xref>). This would represent a departure from simple
  rules expressed at the network scale (<italic>e.g.</italic>

  and Martinez 2000</xref>) to a view of network prediction based on

    <alt-text>The embedding process (A) can help to identify links
    (interactions) that may have been missed within the original
    community (represented by the orange dashed arrows, B). Transfer
    learning (D) allows for the prediction links (interactions) even
    when novel species (C) are included alongside the original
    community. This is achieved by learning using other relevant
    predictors (e.g. traits) in conjunction with the known interactions
    to infer latent values (E). Ultimately this allows us to predict
    links (interactions) for species external from the original sample
    (blue dashed arrows) as well as missing within sample links (F).
    Within this context the predicted (and original) networks as well as
    the ecological predictors used (green boxes) are products that can
    be quantified through measurements in the field, whereas the
    embedded as well as imputed matrices (purple box) are representative
    of a decomposition of the interaction matrices onto the embedding

  <p>Graph (or network) embedding
  ((<xref alt="fig:embedding?" rid="ref-figU003Aembedding" ref-type="bibr"><bold>fig:embedding?</bold></xref>))
  is a family of machine learning techniques, whose main task is to
  learn a mapping function from a discrete graph to a continuous domain
  (<xref alt="Arsov and Mirceva 2019" rid="ref-Arsov2019Network" ref-type="bibr">Arsov
  and Mirceva 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Chami et al. 2022" rid="ref-Chami2022Machine" ref-type="bibr">Chami
  et al. 2022</xref>). Their main goal is to learn a low dimensional
  vector representation of the graph (embeddings), such that its key
  properties (<italic>e.g.</italic> local or global structures) are
  retained in the embedding space
  (<xref alt="Yan et al. 2005" rid="ref-Yan2005Graph" ref-type="bibr">Yan
  et al. 2005</xref>). The embedding space may, but will not
  necessarily, have lower dimensionality than the graph. Ecological
  networks are promising candidates for the routine application of
  embeddings, as they tend to possess a shared structural backbone (see
  <italic>e.g.</italic>
  <xref alt="Bramon Mora et al. 2018" rid="ref-BramonMora2018Identifying" ref-type="bibr">Bramon
  Mora et al. 2018</xref>), which hints at structural invariants in
  empirical data. Assuming that these structural invariants are common
  enough, they would dominate the structure of networks, and therefore
  be adequately captured by the first (lower) dimensions of an
  embedding, without the need to measure derived aspects of their
  structure (<italic>e.g.</italic> motifs, paths, modularity, …).</p>
  <sec id="graph-embedding-produces-latent-variables-but-not-traits">
    <title>Graph embedding produces latent variables (but not
    traits)</title>
    <p>Before moving further, it is important to clarify the epistemic
    status of node values derived from embeddings: specifically, they
    are <italic>not</italic> functional traits, and therefore should not
    be interpreted in terms of effects or responses. As per the
    framework of Malaterre et al.
    (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-Malaterre2019Functional" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>),
    these values neither derive from, nor result in, changes in
    organismal performance, and should therefore not be used to quantify
    <italic>e.g.</italic> functional diversity. This holds true even
    when there are correlations between latent values and functional
    traits: although these enable an ecological discussion of how traits
    condition the structure of the network, the existence of a
    statistical relationship does not elevate the latent values to the
    status of functional traits.</p>
    <p>Rather than directly predicting biological rules (see
    <italic>e.g.</italic>
    <xref alt="Pichler et al. 2020" rid="ref-Pichler2020Machine" ref-type="bibr">Pichler
    et al. 2020</xref> for an overview), which may be confounded by the
    sparse nature of graph data, learning embeddings works in the
    low-dimensional space that maximizes information about the network
    structure. This approach is further justified by the observation,
    for example, that the macro-evolutionary history of a network is
    adequately represented by some graph embeddings [Random dot product
    graphs (RDPG); see Dalla Riva and Stouffer
    (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-DallaRiva2016Exploring" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)].
    In a recent publication, Strydom et al.
    (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-Strydom2022Food" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
    have used an embedding (based on RDPG) to project a metaweb of
    trophic interactions between European mammals, and transferred this
    information to mammals of Canada, using the phylogenetic distance
    between related clades to infer the values in the latent subspace
    into which the European metaweb was projected. By performing the
    RDPG step on re-constructed values, this approach yields a
    probabilistic trophic metaweb for mammals of Canada based on
    knowledge of European species, despite a limited

    an embedding can be used for prediction without being “traits” of

    suggested that there is no dominant method to identify architectural
    similarities between networks: multiple approaches need to be tested
    and compared to the network descriptor of interest on a
    problem-specific basis. This matches previous results on graph
    embedding, wherein different embedding algorithms yield different
    network embeddings
    (<xref alt="Goyal and Ferrara 2018" rid="ref-Goyal2018Graph" ref-type="bibr">Goyal

    problem-specific approach to use. In
    (<xref alt="tbl:methods?" rid="ref-tblU003Amethods" ref-type="bibr"><bold>tbl:methods?</bold></xref>),
    we present a selection of common graph and node embedding methods,
    alongside examples of their use to predict interactions or
    statistical associations between species. These methods rely largely
    on linear algebra or pseudo-random walks on graphs. All forms of
    embeddings presented in
    (<xref alt="tbl:methods?" rid="ref-tblU003Amethods" ref-type="bibr"><bold>tbl:methods?</bold></xref>)
    share the common property of summarizing their objects into (sets
    of) dense feature vectors, that capture the overall network
    structure, pairwise information on nodes, and emergent aspects of
    the network, in a compressed way (<italic>i.e.</italic> with some
    information loss, as we later discuss in the illustration). Node
    embeddings tend to focus on maintaining pairwise relationships
    (<italic>i.e.</italic> species interactions), while graph embeddings
    focus on maintaining the network structure (<italic>i.e.</italic>
    emergent properties). Nevertheless, some graph embedding techniques
    (like RDPG, see <italic>e.g.</italic>
    <xref alt="Wu, Palmer, and Deford 2021" rid="ref-Wu2021Maximum" ref-type="bibr">Wu,
    Palmer, and Deford 2021</xref>) will provide high-quality node-level
    embeddings while also preserving network structure.</p>
    <boxed-text>
    <p><bold>Graph Neural Networks</bold></p>
    <p>One prominent family of approaches we do not discuss in the
    present manuscript is Graph Neural Networks [GNN; Zhou et al.
    (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-Zhou2020Graph" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)].
    GNN are, in a sense, a method to embed a graph into a dense
    subspace, but belong to the family of deep learning methods, which
    has its own set of practices (see <italic>e.g.</italic>
    <xref alt="Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville 2016" rid="ref-Goodfellow2016Deep" ref-type="bibr">Goodfellow,
    Bengio, and Courville 2016</xref>). An important issue with methods
    based on deep learning is that, because their parameter space is
    immense, the sample size of the data fed into them must be similarly
    large (typically thousands of instances). This is a requirement for
    the model to converge correctly during training, but this assumption
    is unlikely to be met given the size of datasets currently available
    for metawebs (or single time/location species interaction networks).
    This data volume requirement is mostly absent from the techniques we
    list below. Furthermore, GNN still have some challenges related to
    their shallow structure, and concerns related to scalability (see
    <xref alt="Atika Gupta, Matta, and Pant 2021" rid="ref-Gupta2021Graph" ref-type="bibr">Atika
    Gupta, Matta, and Pant 2021</xref> for a review), which are mostly
    absent from the methods listed in
    (<xref alt="tbl:methods?" rid="ref-tblU003Amethods" ref-type="bibr"><bold>tbl:methods?</bold></xref>).
    Assuming that the uptake of next-generation biomonitoring techniques
    does indeed deliver larger datasets on species interactions
    (<xref alt="Bohan et al. 2017" rid="ref-Bohan2017Nextgeneration" ref-type="bibr">Bohan
    et al. 2017</xref>), there is nevertheless the potential for GNN to
    become an applicable embedding/predictive technique in the coming
    years.</p>
    </boxed-text>
    <p>Graph embeddings <italic>can</italic> serve as a dimensionality
    reduction method. For example, RDPG
    (<xref alt="Strydom et al. 2022" rid="ref-Strydom2022Food" ref-type="bibr">Strydom
    et al. 2022</xref>) and t-SVD [truncated Singular Value
    Decomposition; Poisot et al.
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-Poisot2021Imputing" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)]
    typically embed networks using fewer dimensions than the original
    network [the original network has as many dimensions as species, and
    as many informative dimensions as trophically unique species;
    Strydom, Dalla Riva, and Poisot
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-Strydom2021Svd" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)].
    However, this is not necessarily the case – indeed, one may perform
    a PCA (a special case of SVD) to project the raw data into a
    subspace that improves the efficacy of t-SNE [t-distributed
    stochastic neighbor embedding; Maaten
    (<xref alt="2009" rid="ref-Maaten2009Learning" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>)].
    There are many dimensionality reductions

    network should the need for dimensionality reduction (for example
    for data visualization) arise. In brief, many graph embeddings

    not all do, neither do all dimensionality reduction methods provide
    adequate graph embedding capacities. In the next section (and

        is concerned with joint-SDM-like approach, which is also very
        close to statistical associations as opposed to direct biotic

    <p>The popularity of graph embedding techniques in machine learning
    is more than the search for structural invariants: graphs are
    discrete objects, and machine learning techniques tend to handle
    continuous data better. Bringing a sparse graph into a continuous,
    dense vector space
    (<xref alt="Xu 2021" rid="ref-Xu2021Understanding" ref-type="bibr">Xu
    2021</xref>) opens up a broader variety of predictive algorithms,
    notably of the sort that are able to predict events as probabilities
    (<xref alt="Murphy 2022" rid="ref-Murphy2022Probabilistic" ref-type="bibr">Murphy
    2022</xref>). Furthermore, the projection of the graph itself is a
    representation that can be learned; Runghen, Stouffer, and Dalla
    Riva
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-Runghen2021Exploiting" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>),
    for example, used a neural network to learn the embedding of a
    network in which not all interactions were known, based on the
    nodes’ metadata. This example has many parallels in ecology (see
    (<xref alt="fig:embedding?" rid="ref-figU003Aembedding" ref-type="bibr"><bold>fig:embedding?</bold></xref>)
    <bold>C</bold>), in which node metadata can be represented by
    phylogeny, abundance, or functional traits. Using phylogeny as a
    source of information assumes (or strives to capture) the action of
    evolutionary processes on network structure, which at least for food
    webs have been well documented

  loss (which is averaged across interactions), as it works on the
  eigenvalues of the embedding, and therefore captures higher-level
  features of the network. In panel <bold>C</bold>, we show positions of
  hosts and parasites on the first two dimensions of the left and right
  subspaces. Note that these values largely skew negative, because the
  first dimensions capture the coarse structure of the network: most
  pairs of species do not interact, and therefore have negative values.
  Finally in panel <bold>D</bold>, we show the predicted weight
  (<italic>i.e.</italic> the result of the multiplication of the RDGP
  subspaces at a rank of 39) as a function of whether the interactions
  are observed, not-observed, or unknown due to lack of co-occurrence in
  the original dataset. This reveals that the observed interactions have
  higher predicted weights, although there is some overlap; the usual
  approach to identify potential interactions based on this information
  would be a thresholding analysis, which is outside the scope of this
  manuscript (and is done in the papers cited in this illustration).
  Because the values returned from RDPG are not bound to the unit
  interval, we performed a clamping of the weights to the unit space,
  showing a one-inflation in documented interactions, and a
  zero-inflation in other species pairs. This last figure crosses from
  the statistical into the ecological, by showing that species pairs
  with no documented co-occurrence have weights that are not
  distinguishable from species pairs with no documented interactions,
  suggesting that (as befits a host-parasite model) the ability to
  interact is a strong predictor of co-occurrence.</p>

  (<xref alt="fig:illustration2?" rid="ref-figU003Aillustration2" ref-type="bibr"><bold>fig:illustration2?</bold></xref>),
  we relate the values of latent variables for hosts to different
  ecologically-relevant data. In panel <bold>A</bold>, we show that host
  with a higher value on the first dimension have fewer parasites. This
  relates to the body size of hosts in the <italic>PanTHERIA</italic>
  database
  (<xref alt="Jones et al. 2009" rid="ref-Jones2009Pantheria" ref-type="bibr">Jones
  et al. 2009</xref>), as shown in panel <bold>B</bold>: interestingly,
  the position on the first axis is only weakly correlated to body mass
  of the host; this matches well established results showing that body
  size/mass is not always a direct predictor of parasite richness in
  terrestrial mammals
  (<xref alt="Morand and Poulin 1998" rid="ref-Morand1998Density" ref-type="bibr">Morand

  Finally, in panel <bold>D</bold>, we can see how different taxonomic
  families occupy different positions on the first axis, with
  <italic>e.g.</italic> Sciuridae being biased towards higher values.
  These results show how we can look for ecological informations in the
  output of network embeddings, which can further be refined into the

  <title>The metaweb merges ecological hypotheses and practices</title>
  <p>Metaweb inference seeks to provide information about the
  interactions between species at a large spatial scale, typically a
  scale large enough to be considered of biogeographic relevance
  (indeed, many of the examples covered in the introduction span areas
  larger than a country, some of them global). But as Herbert
  (<xref alt="1965" rid="ref-Herbert1965Dune" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>)
  rightfully pointed out, “[y]ou can’t draw neat lines around
  planet-wide problems”; any inference of a metaweb must therefore
  contend with several novel, interwoven, families of problems. In this
  section, we outline three that we think are particularly important,
  and can discuss how they may addressed with subsequent data analysis
  or simulations, and how they emerge in the specific context of using
  embeddings; some of these issues are related to the application of
  these methods at the science-policy interface.</p>
  <sec id="identifying-the-properties-of-the-network-to-embed">
    <title>Identifying the properties of the network to embed</title>
    <p>If the initial metaweb is too narrow in scope, notably from a
    taxonomic point of view, the chances of finding another area with
    enough related species (through phylogenetic relatedness or
    similarity of functional traits) to make a reliable inference
    decreases. This is because transfer requires similarity
    ((<xref alt="fig:embedding?" rid="ref-figU003Aembedding" ref-type="bibr"><bold>fig:embedding?</bold></xref>)).
    A diagnostic for the lack of similar species would likely be large
    confidence intervals during estimation of the values in the low-rank
    space. In other words, the representation of the original graph is
    difficult to transfer to the new problem. Alternatively, if the
    initial metaweb is too large (taxonomically), then the resulting
    embeddings would need to represent interactions between taxonomic
    groups that are not present in the new location. This would lead to
    a much higher variance in the starting dataset, and to
    under-dispersion in the target dataset, resulting in the potential
    under or over estimation of the strength of new predicted
    interactions. Llewelyn et al.
    (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-Llewelyn2022Predicting" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
    provided compelling evidence for these situations by showing that,
    even at small spatial scales, the transfer of information about
    interactions becomes more challenging when areas rich with endemic
    species are considered. The lack of well documented metawebs is
    currently preventing the development of more concrete guidelines.
    The question of phylogenetic relatedness and distribution is notably
    relevant if the metaweb is assembled in an area with mostly endemic
    species (<italic>e.g.</italic> a system that has undergone recent
    radiation or that has remained in isolation for a long period of
    time might not have an analogous system with which to draw knowledge
    from), and as with every predictive algorithm, there is room for the
    application of our best ecological judgement. Because this problem
    relates to distribution of species in the geographic or phylogenetic
    space, it can certainly be approached through assessing the
    performance of embedding transfer in simulated starting/target
    species pools.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="identifying-the-scope-of-the-prediction-to-perform">
    <title>Identifying the scope of the prediction to perform</title>
    <p>The area for which we seek to predict the metaweb should
    determine the species pool on which the embedding is performed.
    Metawebs can be constructed by assigning interactions in a list of
    species within specific regions. The upside of this approach is that
    information relevant for the construction of this dataset is likely
    to exist, as countries usually set conservation goals at the
    national level
    (<xref alt="Buxton et al. 2021" rid="ref-Buxton2021Key" ref-type="bibr">Buxton
    et al. 2021</xref>), and as quantitative instruments are
    consequently designed to work at these scales
    (<xref alt="Turak et al. 2017" rid="ref-Turak2017Using" ref-type="bibr">Turak
    et al. 2017</xref>); specific strategies are often enacted at
    smaller scales, nested within a specific country
    (<xref alt="Ray, Grimm, and Olive 2021" rid="ref-Ray2021Biodiversity" ref-type="bibr">Ray,
    Grimm, and Olive 2021</xref>). However, there is no guarantee that
    these arbitrary boundaries are meaningful. In fact, we do not have a
    satisfying answer to the question of “where does an ecological
    network stop?”, the answer to which would dictate the spatial span
    to embed/predict. Recent results by Martins et al.
    (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-Martins2022Global" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
    suggested that networks are shaped within eco-regions, with abrupt
    structural transitions from an eco-region to the next. Should this
    trend hold generally, this would provide an ecologically-relevant
    scale at which metawebs can be downscaled and predicted. Other
    solutions could leverage network-area relationships to identify
    areas in which networks are structurally similar (see
    <italic>e.g.</italic>

    Both of these solutions require ample pre-existing information about
    the network in space. Nevertheless, the inclusion of species for
    which we have data but that are not in the right spatial extent
    <italic>may</italic> improve the performance of approaches based on
    embedding and transfer, <italic>if</italic> they increase the
    similarity between the target and destination network. This proposal
    can specifically be evaluated by adding nodes to the network to
    embed, and assessing the performance of predictive models (see

  <title>Conclusion: metawebs, predictions, and people</title>
  <p>Predictive approaches in ecology, regardless of the scale at which
  they are deployed and the intent of their deployment, originate in the
  framework that contributed to the ongoing biodiversity crisis
  (<xref alt="Adam 2014" rid="ref-Adam2014Elephant" ref-type="bibr">Adam

  (<xref alt="Choudry 2013" rid="ref-Choudry2013Saving" ref-type="bibr">Choudry

  <xref alt="Domínguez and Luoma 2020" rid="ref-Dominguez2020Decolonising" ref-type="bibr">Domínguez
  and Luoma 2020</xref>). The risk of embedding this legacy in our
  models is real, especially when the impact of this legacy on species
  pools is being increasingly documented. This problem can be addressed
  by re-framing the way we interact with models, especially when models
  are intended to support conservation actions. Particularly on
  territories that were traditionally stewarded by Indigenous people, we
  must interrogate how predictive approaches and the biases that
  underpin them can be put to task in accompanying Indigenous principles
  of land management
  (<xref alt="Eichhorn, Baker, and Griffiths 2019" rid="ref-Eichhorn2019Steps" ref-type="bibr">Eichhorn,

  <xref alt="No’kmaq et al. 2021" rid="ref-Nokmaq2021Awakening" ref-type="bibr">No’kmaq
  et al. 2021</xref>). The discussion of “algorithm-in-the-loop”
  approaches that is now pervasive in the machine learning community
  provides examples of why this is important. Human-algorithm
  interactions are notoriously difficult and can yield adverse effects
  (<xref alt="Green and Chen 2019" rid="ref-Green2019Disparate" ref-type="bibr">Green

  <xref alt="Stevenson and Doleac 2021" rid="ref-Stevenson2021Algorithmic" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson
  and Doleac 2021</xref>), suggesting the need to systematically study
  them for the specific purpose of, here, biodiversity governance.
  Improving the algorithmic literacy of decision makers is part of the
  solution (<italic>e.g.</italic>
  <xref alt="Lamba et al. 2019" rid="ref-Lamba2019Deep" ref-type="bibr">Lamba
  et al. 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Mosebo Fernandes et al. 2020" rid="ref-MoseboFernandes2020Machine" ref-type="bibr">Mosebo
  Fernandes et al. 2020</xref>), as we can reasonably expect that model
  outputs will be increasingly used to drive policy decisions
  (<xref alt="Weiskopf et al. 2022" rid="ref-Weiskopf2022Increasing" ref-type="bibr">Weiskopf
  et al. 2022</xref>). Our discussion of these approaches need to go
  beyond the technical and statistical, and into the governance
  consequences they can have. To embed data also embeds historical and
  contemporary biases that acted on these data, both because they shaped
  the ecological processes generating them, and the global processes
  leading to their measurement and publication. For a domain as vast as
  species interaction networks, these biases exist at multiple scales
  along the way, and a challenge for prediction is not only to develop
  (or adopt) new quantitative tools, but to assess the behavior of these
  tools in the proper context.</p>
  <boxed-text>
  <p><bold>Minding legacies shaping ecological datasets</bold></p>
  <p>In large parts of the world, boundaries that delineate geographic
  regions are merely a reflection the legacy of settler colonialism,
  which drives global disparity in capacity to collect and publish
  ecological data. Applying any embedding to biased data does not debias
  them, but rather embeds these biases, propagating them to the models
  using embeddings to make predictions. Furthermore, the use of
  ecological data itself is not an apolitical act
  (<xref alt="Nost and Goldstein 2021" rid="ref-Nost2021Political" ref-type="bibr">Nost
  and Goldstein 2021</xref>): data infrastructures tend to be designed
  to answer questions within national boundaries (therefore placing
  contingencies on what is available to be embedded), their use often
  drawing upon, and reinforcing, territorial statecraft (see
  <italic>e.g.</italic>
  <xref alt="Barrett 2005" rid="ref-Barrett2005Environment" ref-type="bibr">Barrett
  2005</xref>). As per Machen and Nost
  (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-Machen2021Thinking" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>),
  these biases are particularly important to consider when knowledge
  generated algorithmically is used to supplement or replace human
  decision-making, especially for governance (<italic>e.g.</italic>
  enacting conservation decisions on the basis of model prediction). As
  information on networks is increasingly leveraged for conservation
  actions (see <italic>e.g.</italic>
  <xref alt="Eero et al. 2021" rid="ref-Eero2021Use" ref-type="bibr">Eero

  <xref alt="Stier et al. 2017" rid="ref-Stier2017Integrating" ref-type="bibr">Stier
  et al. 2017</xref>), the need to appraise and correct biases that are
  unwittingly propagated to algorithms when embedded from the original
  data is immense. These considerations are even more urgent in the
  specific context of biodiversity data. Long-term colonial legacies
  still shape taxonomic composition to this day
  (<xref alt="Lenzner et al. 2022" rid="ref-Lenzner2022Naturalized" ref-type="bibr">Lenzner
  et al. 2022</xref>;
  <xref alt="Raja 2022" rid="ref-Raja2022Colonialism" ref-type="bibr">Raja

  richness of wildlife emerged through environmental racism
  (<xref alt="Schmidt and Garroway 2022" rid="ref-Schmidt2022Systemic" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt
  and Garroway 2022</xref>). Thus, the set of species found at a
  specific location is not only as the result of a response to
  ecological processes separate from human influence, but also the
  result of human-environment interaction as well as the result
  legislative/political histories.</p>

<p>Dear members of the Methods in Ecology and Evolution editorial
board,</p>
<p>On behalf of my co-authors, I am pleased to submit our manuscript
entitled “Predicting metawebs: transfer of graph embeddings can help
alleviate spatial data deficiencies” for consideration as a Perspective
Article in Methods in Ecology and Evolution. This manuscript is the
off-shoot of another manuscript that is currently under review at
Methods in Ecology and Evolution (ID MEE-21-11-855.R1) and discusses
topics previously included in the original manuscript, that were removed
so as to keep the focus of the original manuscript on the methodological
framework and maintain some sense of brevity. We have discussed this
decision to split the original manuscript with the EiC Prof. Nicolas
Lecomte, who has approved this decision. This submission thus puts
forward a broader discussion as to how the transferring of graph
embeddings could prove to be a practical tool in addressing the spatial
data deficiencies we are faced with when working with ecological
networks, and provides an overview of the graph embedding
techniques.</p>
<p>Metawebs (networks of potential interactions within a species pool),
have the potential to be a powerful starting point from which to
understand how large-scales species interaction networks are structured.
However, the challenges inherit in sampling species interactions makes
assembling sufficient data at a large enough scale a tedious and costly
process. Predictive methods can help in circumventing these limitations,
of these predictive tools available graph embeddings (rather than
focusing on the list of species interactions) holds, great potential. In
this perspective, we outline how the challenges associated with
inferring metawebs line-up with the advantages of graph embeddings; as
well as how the choice of the species pool not only has consequences on
the reconstructed network, but also embeds hypotheses about which
human-made boundaries are ecologically meaningful.</p>
<p>The work described here has not been published elsewhere. All authors
agree with the the manuscript content and its submission to the journal.
No part of this manuscript has been published in any form elsewhere or
is being considered for publication elsewhere while it is being
considered for publication in this journal. This manuscript appeared as
a preprint on EcoEvoRXiV with the following DOI:
10.32942/osf.io/vyzgr.</p>
<p>We look forward to your editorial decision on this manuscript.</p>
<p><bold>Suitability statement:</bold></p>
<disp-quote>
  <p>The discussion in this perspective piece will help in further the
  discussion on the use and applicability of metawebs as well providing
  readers with an overview of how the use of graph embedding can help us
  to construct ecologically plausible metawebs with which to work.</p>

  <title>Senior Editor Comments to Authors</title>
  <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to Methods in Ecology and
  Evolution. I have now received the reviewers’ reports and a
  recommendation from the Associate Editor who handled the review
  process of your resubmission. Copies of their reports are included
  below. This manuscript has the potential to make a valuable
  contribution to the area, but there are still a number of significant
  concerns that need to be addressed. I have considered your paper in
  light of the comments received and I would like to invite you to
  prepare a major revision. Although the status is considered as major
  (to give you more time to address the comments), I see that most of
  the comments can be easily addressed and fit well in the flow of the
  paper. I commend all your work in this resubmitted paper.</p>
  <p>In addition to addressing the comments from the reviewers and the
  Associate Editor, I also have some comments of my own that should be
  addressed:</p>
  <p>The last comment of Rev #5 suggests to replace the last 2 sections
  by “relevant information on the benefits, shortcomings and road ahead
  for the proposed framework”. My view is that you can keep the two last
  sections as they are particularly relevant in a perspective paper and
  go beyond our scientific methods. However, I agree with the reviewer
  that you should add the practical elements for the road ahead.</p>
  <p>With respect to section “Minding legacies shaping ecological
  datasets”, I would suggest to add suggestions and ways to solve or at
  least account for the issue from an analytical standpoint. We are left
  wondering how to deal with the bias in a quantitive manner. I
  appreciate how much that section was difficult to frame and be mindful
  and respectful of how data were gathered. It is an important reminder
  of how much work is left to do and the history and geographical
  biases.</p>
  <p>I recognised that part of the reception of the ms is linked to the
  unfamiliar format of perspective papers that navigating between
  opinion, quantitative aspects, and novel ideas.</p>
  <p>My take on comment #1 of rev. #5 is that more “connecting
  sentences” and titles between sections will be an easy fix.</p>

  <title>Reviewer 5</title>
  <p>Comments to the Corresponding Author In ms. MEE-23-01-050, the
  authors discuss the use of graph embedding to predict species
  interactions in ecological networks. By mapping these networks as
  low-dimensional vectors, graph embedding can potentially identify
  species that are likely to interact with one another. The paper
  reviews recent published studies that show promising results and
  presents a framework that can be implemented through Julia libraries,
  with source codes available in online repositories. Overall, the paper
  is well-written and addresses a hot topic in predictive ecology, how
  to reliably predict biotic interactions. Unfortunately, it falls short
  at providing a clear overview of the proposed approach, its potential
  benefits, possible limitations or misuse, and the desirable next
  steps.</p>
  <sec id="major-comments-nb-2">
    <title>Major comments</title>
    <p>A major concern relates to the structuring (or lack thereof) of
    the paper. While many interesting ideas are presented in the ms.,
    there is not a cohesive narrative, conclusions are somewhat
    unrelated to the paper’s core and some subsections seem rather
    disconnected from what one would expect to read based on their
    titles. For example, it is hard to see how the paragraph aimed at
    showing how graph embedding is under-used to predict biotic
    interactions (lines 150-180) does so. Instead, the authors use this
    section to explain why Graph Neural Networks are not discussed in
    the ms., or why embedding would suit ecological networks (why not
    discussing in more depth the findings presented in table 1?). As
    another example, the authors provide an interesting empirical
    illustration of metaweb embedding, but this exercise is largely
    disconnected from the rest of the paper. And as a final example, the
    paper ends with historical-political implications on ecological data
    biases, which may be interesting, but is not obviously linked to
    graph embedding. Overall, the structure of the paper should be
    improved by better connecting sections following a clear narrative,
    better connecting the subsection contents to their titles, and thus
    avoiding the mere juxtaposition of not clearly related ideas.</p>
    <p>One of the most active areas of network science is the
    development of algorithms to complete information represented in the
    form of interaction networks, by making probability estimations for
    both recorded and unrecorded connections. This allows for the
    identification of connections that may exist but have not yet been
    observed. In this sense, there are already hundreds of algorithms
    that can generate these probabilities based solely on the existing
    network structure. Moreover, there have been many performance
    evaluations of these algorithms, some of them very exhaustive,
    including hundreds of these methods (Ghasemian et al. 2020:PNAS), so
    some general conclusions can be drawn. One particularly relevant
    observation for the manuscript under review is that embedding
    algorithms tend to perform worse than algorithms from other
    families. It is worth noting that the purpose of the predictive
    methods described in the reviewed article (i.e., estimating
    interaction probabilities within metawebs and not for local
    networks) does not exactly coincide with the algorithms evaluated by
    Ghasemian et al. (2020). However, since all algorithms used belong
    to the embedding family (the least favored in that evaluation), we
    believe it is necessary for the authors to explain why these
    algorithms, and not others from different families, are more
    suitable for making predictions in the case of metawebs.</p>
    <p>The authors propose the construction of a metaweb as a starting
    point for link prediction. Nevertheless, a metaweb is already a
    hypothesis over a known network and contains potentially
    non-realized interactions in nature which could lead to misleading
    results. Even though, high quality metawebs can be built through
    hard labor and expert knowledge, this is difficult to achieve in
    practice due to the effort required and is perhaps only feasible for
    very well-known groups or species interactions. We would like some
    explanation of why we should use a metaweb instead of known
    networks, and to what extent we should trust the results coming from
    a metaweb with spurious interactions? Beyond highlighting the
    potential benefits of metawebs, we believe it is imperative to make
    clear their limitations and potential biases when using them for
    link prediction.</p>
    <p>The ability of the proposed framework to make predictions beyond
    the original network is promising, but it may be challenging to find
    suitable metadata for the data elements to be predicted. For some
    (if not many) groups, the metadata that is correlated with the
    realization of interactions in a network may be scarce or simply
    unavailable. While it is possible to identify relevant metadata by
    inspecting the relationship between variables and the features
    extracted from the model (as shown in Figure 3 of the manuscript),
    relying solely on this approach could lead to poorly defined models
    and inaccurate predictions. Here, the authors fail to describe in
    detail ways to validate the results and predictions of the
    framework, as this would be essential to assess the performance and
    reliability of the models resulting from its application.</p>

    <p>L16-23: it is unclear how the alpha-gamma diversity scheme
    transfers to the network context, please clarify.</p>
    <p>L25-27: this passage is a bit confusing. If co-occurrence is
    driven by interactions, then it is not a predictor of interactions
    but a response to interactions (we know it can be both). Yet,
    co-occurrence has been identified as a predictor of interactions,
    able to even discriminate among (some) interaction types and
    strength (see Araújo and Rozenfeld 2014:Ecography). Please make
    these sentences clearer.</p>
    <p>L36: please cite also prior research on predicting climate change
    effects on interacting assemblages using functional, phylogenetic
    and macroecological information (e.g. Morales-Castilla et
    al. 2021:PhilTransRoySocB; Carlson et al. 2022:Nature).</p>
    <p>L36: “These local networks may be reconstructed given an
    appropriate knowledge of local species composition and provide
    information on the structure of FOOD WEBS at finer spatial
    scales.”</p>
    <p>Is this a typo, or are the authors focusing only on food webs and
    not species interaction webs in general? In L140 they refer again to
    “trophically unique species”, so if the authors are referring only
    to food webs, make that clear up front.</p>
    <p>L57-59: The idea that a probabilistic representation of a network
    is superior to a binary one for link prediction is open to question.
    Constructing a probabilistic model for predicting the likelihood of
    each interaction requires making subjective decisions, and if these
    decisions are not well-informed, the benefits of using quantitative
    data instead of binary may be negated. Furthermore, the authors
    state that one advantage of a probabilistic representation is the
    ability to weight rare interactions, which is interesting but
    requires providing some reference or evidence supporting it.</p>
    <p>L78-80: isn’t this the same idea as the backbone of biotic
    interactions, where all unfeasible interactions are pruned,
    suggested in Morales-castilla et al. 2015:TrendsEcolEvol?</p>
    <p>L91: representation</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>Done</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L107: Since the fact that latent values cannot be equated to
    traits may seem obvious, it would help illustrating here with
    examples, papers that have used those latent values as traits, and
    being clearer as to which consequences making this mistake
    involves.</p>
    <p>L149-180: Section “Graph embedding has been under-used in the
    prediction of species interactions”. First, it is unclear how this
    section shows what is stated before in lines 147-148 “In the next
    section we show how the amount of dimensionality reduction can
    affect the quality of the embedding”. Second, this section is
    composed of two paragraphs. One explaining Graph Neural Networks and
    other about the latent features extracted by graph embedding and
    their relation to commonly use metadata. None actually directly
    relates to the section title.</p>
    <p>L213-: “This last figure crosses from the statistical into the
    ecological, by showing that species pairs with no documented
    co-occurrence have weights that are not distinguishable from species
    pairs with no documented interactions, suggesting that (as befits a
    host-parasite model) the ability to interact is a strong predictor
    of co-occurrence.”</p>
    <p>We cannot make truly sense of this sentence. We understand that
    the authors interpret Figure 2D as suggesting that when two species
    are capable of interacting with each other, they are more likely to
    co-occur in the same environment, but we cannot not follow this as
    logic. Please, clarify.</p>
    <p>L222: what is the logical consequence from the previous sentence?
    Is therefore needed?</p>
    <p>L242-262: Again the content of the subsection is not clearly
    related to the title. If these properties are scale, number of
    species, and proportion of endemics-rare species, then it should be
    stated more clearly</p>
    <p>L271: this is a pervasive issue in ecology, as delineating
    individuals, populations or communities has never been a resolved
    issue. communities do not have objective boundaries… see
    e.g. Sterelny, K. (2006):PhilSci,73. While noting this is
    interesting, it would be even more interesting to discussing which
    are the implications of predicting interactions at varying scales,
    e.g., at which scales would false positives or negatives
    predominate, and to which purposes different inferences would be
    more adequate</p>
    <p>L282: In the section titled “Minding legacies shaping ecological
    datasets”, the authors refer to how embedding-based methods could be
    affected by geographic biases that exist in the availability and
    quality of biodiversity data, indicating that where these biases
    exist, they will not be corrected by these methods, but will be
    transferred to the predictions made using them. Although the
    existence of these geographical biases is well known, this call for
    attention is relevant when promoting the use of methods that could
    lead the unsuspecting user to believe that they are a panacea immune
    to these data limitations. Moreover, it would have been appreciated
    if the authors had referred to procedures or protocols aimed at
    minimizing the effects of these biases, or at least made useful
    recommendations to the reader about in which circumstances, or in
    which specific territories applying these methods can be of greater
    utility, and where there is a greater risk of obtaining spurious
    results. This practical approach is at least what much of the
    audience of Methods in Ecology and Evolution would expect. However,
    instead doing this, the authors opted for claiming that these
    geographic biases are often a legacy of colonialist dynamics and
    environmental racism that must be rectified. But what practical
    utility does this have for the reader of this piece? We believe
    none, beyond knowing the concern that these and other authors have
    for issues of social injustice. However, is MEE a proper forum to
    show this?</p>
    <p>L304: how do approaches to predict ecology reinforce
    environmental injustices? how does that relate to the paper’s
    topic?</p>
    <p>Overall, the length of information and detail provided by the
    authors in the last two sections of the manuscript about legacy
    biases should be mainly replaced by relevant information on the
    benefits, shortcomings and road ahead for the proposed framework. In
    particular, some discussion on how this method is better than
    similar methods would be welcome.</p>

  <title>Senior Editor Comments to Authors</title>
  <p>I have now received the reviewers’ reports and a recommendation
  from the Associate Editor who handled the review process of your
  resubmission. Copies of their reports are included below. Based on
  their evaluations, I regret to inform you that we are unable to
  publish your paper in Methods in Ecology and Evolution in its current
  form.</p>
  <p>However, we would be willing to consider another resubmission,
  which takes into consideration the new feedback you have received. You
  will see that several comments really ask for a structural rework
  towards the core of the “Perspective” format of MEE, which is about
  the stimulation of scientific debate and the offer of conceptual
  advances. While the ms is giving some of that, it does not convince
  readers and reviewers even after 2 reviews.</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p>We are deeply grateful for the opportunity to revise our
    manuscript. We have conducted a thorough round of changes. Notably,
    we have expanded the example greatly, by adding new data from the
    <italic>PanTHERIA</italic> database. We have re-organized the
    section providing an overview of embedding techniques, and reworked
    the table to highlight differences between the various methods. We
    have re-worked the conclusion to frame it around what we believe to
    be exciting emerging questions, which we hope will stimulate
    discussions around this topic moving forward.</p>
  </disp-quote>
  <p>I think that reframing how it is presented would go a long way to
  appeal to readers and current &amp; future users of graph embedding.
  It is not usual for us to offer the possibility to resubmit after a
  first “reject and resubmit” decision when the reviews are of that
  extent and we did so because of there is a potential for the ms to
  have all these comments (mentioned below) addressed. A new version
  including all these (numerous) comments would still need much work but
  would really allow the ms to be a useful roadmap towards predicting
  metaweb (even if that means going above the word limit).</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p>We apologize in advance for taking the last comment at face
    value, and going over the word limit. This was, in part, necessary
    to bring several elements of nuance that are present in the
    literature cited, but that have been asked by reviewers to be part
    of the text. Notably, we added an explanation of why the result of
    an embedding is not a functional trait. We have also re-worked the
    conceptual figure to give it more generality. Furthermore, we had to
    clarify the relationship between embedding and dimensionality
    reduction. All of these changes required to expand the text at
    several places, but we are confident that this brings the manuscript
    closer to the reviewers’ vision.</p>
  </disp-quote>
  <p>In addition, there are several comments from the previous round
  that were not addressed but still created issues with the second
  revision; dealing with them and using the additional perspective of
  this new revision will help move the ms forward.</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p>As far as we understand it, this comment stems from Reviewer 3’s
    in-depth reading of the original submission, our responses, and the
    revised submission. We do appreciate the effort invested, but this
    resulted in a review where it was often unclear which material was
    critiqued, and therefore left us with little in the way of
    actionnable items. There are a number of claims by reviewer 3 that
    we dispute, and we have added our detailed responses below. It was
    our impression that all points from the previous round of comments
    had been adressed, but we would appreciate specific guidance as to
    which were not properly so, in order to fix it should this situation
    indeed present itself.</p>

  <title>Reviewer 3 Comments to Authors</title>

    <title>General comments</title>
    <p>The manuscript is a resubmission of a previous version that I did
    not review nor see. I understand that the manuscript is proposed for
    publication under the “Perspective” type in MEE. Besides the current
    version, I had access to the first reports and the authors’
    answers.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for the obvious effort they put in their
      comments. Yet, we do want to express concern (which we will do
      more explicitly in the following responses) that what the comments
      are about is often unclear; it has been sometimes difficult for us
      to understand whether the reviewer was expressing criticism about
      the revised manuscript, our previous set of responses, or even
      previously published manuscripts from this working group.
      Nevertheless, we have done our best to take the comments at face
      value and address them in depth in the revision, whenever they
      were about the current submission. Whenever the reviewer
      identified issues with previous material that were also relevant
      for this submission, we have similarly worked hard at integrating
      them. We hope that the editor will appreciate the difficulty of
      crafting a thorough response when the reviewer comments bear on
      material that is not currently under consideration.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>I think that the contents of this Perspective manuscript do not -
    as required by the journal guidelines - “stimulate [much] scientific
    debate”. Neither does it significantly “offer conceptual advances or
    opinions or identify gaps”. I’ll now try to motivate this
    opinion.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We think this criticism is unfair, as we had already outlined
      in the responses how the <italic>original submission</italic>
      introduced novel ideas, and notably identified
      knowledge/methodological gaps. We have re-worked the discussion of
      <italic>this resubmission</italic> to frame it around what we
      believe are important issues, including examples of analyses that
      can be carried out to start working on these problems. As such, we
      are extremely confident about the novelty of the material
      presented in <italic>this resubmission</italic>.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>In their answers, the authors “point out that the submitted
    version of this present manuscript includes” 3 different elements.
    It is unclear to me whether they consider this to be the complete
    list of the manuscript contributions.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This specific comment in the <italic>initial responses</italic>
      was intended to highlight areas that were already in the
      <italic>original submission</italic>, specifically areas that
      constitute the “advances to the scientific debate” the reviewer
      asked for in their previous point. We used the word
      <italic>include</italic> here to unambiguously convey that this
      was not an exhaustive enumeration; as we are criticized on a
      matter of semantics, we wanted to make this unambigous. We would
      like to note that a description of what the <italic>current
      submission</italic> contains is given in the abstract of the
      <italic>current submission</italic>. As the reviewer has not
      formulated actionable critiques about the manuscript (such as, for
      example, identification of areas needing a better description of
      what the manuscript brings), no changes were made.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Anyway, let me discuss the first of these elements. It is “an
    overview of embedding techniques and their application to species
    interaction networks”. I do not agree with this first claim. In my
    opinion, Table 1 that lists a large number of graph embedding
    techniques is not sufficient to be considered an overview.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have edited the text to clarify that the take-home message
      from this table is that a large number of these methods have
      <italic>not</italic> been applied to species interactions
      networks, and clarified which have been applied to biological
      associations (without being about biotic interactions <italic>per
      se</italic>).</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The authors barely address the difference between nodes embedding
    and graph embedding: while I can clearly see the second column of
    the table, the text does not contain any sentence that could help a
    reader not familiar with these embedding techniques to learn about
    this major difference.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have added a description of the difference (and overlap)
      between the categories of embeddings to the main text, as well as
      in the table. We have futher re-worked this part of the text so
      that the flow is more consistent, starting with why ecological
      networks can be embedded, clarifying the status of the values
      given by these embeddings, and then making the explicit point that
      these methods have been under-used.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The text is even misleading when (line 75) the authors say that
    “Their [the graph embedding techniques] main goal is to learn a low
    dimensional vector representations for the nodes of the graph
    (embeddings)”.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have changed this sentence. We are unsure as to whether it
      will satisfy the reviewer, as they have not indicated how they
      thought the original one was misleading.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>An overview of embedding techniques should go beyond a list of
    references and come with (at least some lines of) an introduction to
    the methods and their main differences.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We would like to clarify that the purpose of this paper is to
      point out that a family of methods (embedding) has been under-used
      in the study of ecological networks, despite their potential
      usefulness to be related to additional data for transfer learning.
      This is now apparent from the sub-titles of this section of the
      text. What the reviewer suggests is a review or benchmark on each
      of the methods, which is outside the scope of a perspective
      manuscript, and more suitable for a review. This is written in the
      introduction of the <italic>current submission</italic>.
      Furthermore, there is no concise way to summarize most of these
      methods in “some lines”. Embedding techniques can be extremely
      complex, often use vastly different mathematical approaches, and
      it would be a disservice not to point to the original litterature
      instead.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Going back to the manuscript contributions, the end of the
    paper’s introduction (from lines 37 to 40), sets a slightly
    different list: “In this contribution, we highlight the power in
    viewing (and constructing) metawebs as probabilistic objects in the
    context of rare interactions, discuss how a family of machine
    learning tools (graph embeddings and transfer learning) can be used
    to overcome data limitations to metaweb inference, and highlight how
    the use of metawebs introduces important questions for the field of
    network ecology.” From this, I understand that the 3 elements
    pointed out by the authors in their answer do not constitute the
    core of their contribution, which is rather described by these
    previous lines. This leads me to my next remark.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This comment is purely a consequence of the reviewer, with all
      due respect, over-interpreting the responses to the editor and
      using them as the basis for critiques of the <italic>re-submitted
      manuscript</italic>. From this point onwards, it is difficult for
      us to decide what the reviewer is actually discussing. For the
      sake of clarity, let us re-state the manuscript “mission
      statement”: viewing metawebs as probabilistic objects is likely to
      be very fruitful for their prediction and study, and coupling
      graph embeddings with transfer learning is a promising way
      forward, but requires us to solve problems before we get there.
      This is the last paragraph of the introduction in plain English;
      no changes made specifically in response to this point.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The previous reports raised the concern that the current
    manuscript “adds little to the previous published paper”. The
    authors answered that “there is not a single instance where areas of
    overlap are clearly identified”. I do identify specific places that
    support the reports concern:</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have to front-load the response to the specific points by
      stating that we fully stand by our original point, namely that
      there is no overlap, and that no overlap was identified in the
      previous round of review. This attempt by reviewer 3 to re-write
      the history of the previous round of comments is baffling. We
      would like to mention to the editor that we do not understand the
      point of the following comments. Nevertheless, we are taking the
      process of peer review seriously, and have engaged with all of
      these comments in good faith.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The contents of the paper as described at the end of the
    introduction match the ideas underlying the previous published
    work;</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We re-read both manuscripts in full, and the only “overlap”
      that we could find (keeping in mind that the end of the
      introduction of the <italic>re-submitted version</italic> was
      modified following comments in the previous round of review) is
      that some of the same general ideas are discussed; this is
      unavoidable in order to convey foundational ideas that justify the
      use of embeddings coupled to transfer learning: the existence of
      conserved backbones, invariants, or action of
      phylogenetic/trait-based processes. We would like to note that the
      reviewer is not identifying a problem here, simply stating that
      articles on similar concepts cover similar conceptual grounds in
      their introduction.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Section “Graph embedding offers promises for the inference of
    potential interactions” is not only “an overview of embedding
    techniques” but rather it is biased towards “their application to
    species interaction networks”, which is the topic of the previous
    published paper.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is correct; it is, in fact, stated as early as the title
      of the manuscript (to wit: “Graph embedding and transfer learning
      can help predict species interaction networks despite data
      limitations”). Again, this comment is based on the
      <italic>responses to reviewers</italic> from the previous round,
      and has no actionable items related to the <italic>current
      version</italic> of the manuscript. The point of the
      <italic>current submission</italic> is to provide a higher level
      <italic>perspective</italic> on the topic, of which the
      <italic>previously published paper</italic> was a specific
      case-study. The novelty of this submission is in (1) the broader
      and more systematic coverage of the literature on embeddings, (2)
      a discussion of transfer learning in a more systematic way, framed
      by the “in sample”/“out of sample” distinction we added to Fig. 1,
      and (3) an enumeration of what we believe are important questions
      for the field to address.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Graph embedding techniques are promising for ecological networks,
    obviously not only in the context of inferring a metaweb. This leads
    us back to the main concern with this paragraph: that the authors do
    not even have a sentence about the major difference between node
    embeddings and whole graphs embeddings shows that they are not
    interested in these techniques for ecological networks in
    general.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We would appreciate that the reviewer refrains from commenting
      on our “interest”, when we have been thinking about/working
      on/publishing with these techniques for several years. We have
      added information about the difference between different types of
      embeddings, which we hope will help the reviewer evaluate the
      seriousness of our interest in the topic.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Figure 1 is titled “Overview of the embedding process”, which
    describes only part A and B so half of the scheme. The remainder is
    concerned with the method from the previously published paper.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>The last part of this comment is untrue, but we have lost
      interest in tracing comments back to discussion of the past round
      of reviews. The figure describes a general cycle of
      input/embedding/transfer/inference, with specific mentions of
      potential predictors to learn the embedding. We have changed the
      title of the figure, and based on constructive comments from other
      reviewers, have re-drawn it entirely.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The third element of the list pointed out by the authors in their
    answer is “a discussion of the remaining technical and
    methodological challenges associated with this approach”. Here I
    understood that “this” refers to “prediction through embeddings” and
    the title of the last section ( “The metaweb embeds both ecological
    hypotheses and practices”) is slightly misleading as its contents
    are rather biased towards inference of a metaweb (after its
    embedding).</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is, again, a comment on the <italic>responses to
      reviewers</italic>, which requires no change to the
      <italic>current submission</italic>. Based on constructive
      comments by other reviewers, the last section of the manuscript
      has been re-organised, and the text should now flow more naturally
      between these emerging issues.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>For the authors (line 172) “The first open research problem is
    the taxonomic and spatial limit of the metaweb to embed and
    transfer” and (line 189) “The second series of problems relate to
    determining which area should be used to infer the new metaweb”.
    These two points could have formed a perspective in the previous
    published paper.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We wholeheartedly agree, but they had to be cut to adhere to
      space constraints. No changes requested, no changes made, intent
      of the comment still unclear.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The last part (from line 203, “praxis of ecological research”)
    opens to more general considerations but again contains specific
    remarks related to their previous work: “Applying any embedding to
    biased data does not debias them” (line 206); “the need to appraise
    and correct biases that are unwittingly propagated to algorithms
    when embedded” (line 215).</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We dispute this comment. The ideas contained in this paragraph
      have no relationship to our previous work, and this should be
      obvious by examining the literature cited. No changes made to the
      manuscript.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The second element of the list pointed out by the authors in
    their answer is “a discussion of the properties of metawebs that
    make them amenable to prediction through embeddings”. I did not
    clearly identify which part of the manuscript corresponds to that
    element. I can only suppose that this refers to the paragraph that
    “a metaweb is an inherently probabilistic object”, but as far as I
    understand, the paragraph does not make a clear link between these
    properties and the amenability to prediction through embedding.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is, again, a comment on the <italic>responses to
      reviewers</italic>; we hope that the changes we made in response
      to reviewer’s 5 very constructive comments on the text of the
      actual manuscript have adequately addressed it.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>While I am convinced that “a metaweb is an inherently
    probabilistic object” and found interesting the part of the
    manuscript between lines 42 to 57, I did not understand how this is
    combined with the second half of this section (namely that “high
    quality observational data” can be combined “with synthetic data
    coming from predictive models” to “increase the volume of
    information available for inference”). More precisely, that `[the
    metaweb] fixes an upper bound on which interactions can exist’ is
    not clearly improved by a probabilistic version of this metaweb.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This section has been modified following comments from other
      reviewers, specifically by addressing the status of documented v.
      undocumented interactions, and how probabilities outputted by
      predictive models can help bridge the gap.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The manuscript points the need for the construction of metawebs
    at large spatial and taxonomic scales. The authors are not specific
    about what “large” is exactly. It would be interesting to be more
    specific on that or provide some examples. Is this a world-wide
    scale? A continental scale? Any scale for which aggregation of local
    data is necessary? Anything else? Line 192 (and below) appears the
    mention of “country level”; However countries are too heterogeneous
    in their sizes to answer my point. Also, the term ‘continental
    scale’ appears on line 217 but in a specific sentence and I am not
    convinced that this is exactly what the authors have in mind when
    mentioning “large” scales.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This has been addressed in the revised discussion.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>The abstract contains the sentence (point 4) “[we] discuss how
    the choice of the species pool has consequences on the reconstructed
    network”. This is indeed an interesting question. But I did not see
    anything in the text that could refer to this.</p>

    <p>line 10: “accurate predictors are important for accurate
    predictions”. Indeed, but what is your point?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>Our point is given in plain English immediately after the
      comma: “the lack of methods that can leverage a small amount of
      <italic>accurate</italic> data is a serious impediment to our
      predictive ability”.</p>

    <p>I understand that the paragraph on GNN (from line 88) was added

    much space not to speak about GNN as to speak about (ML) graph
    embeddings.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We added this paragraph in response to comments from a
      reviewer, and we agreed with the original point raised by the
      reviewer, specifically that readers may be curious about GNNs; no
      changes made.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>I understand that the illustration of metaweb embedding was added
    to answer one of the referees of the first round. Nonetheless, I do
    not see the added value of it.</p>

      added value clearer. See responses to the other reviewers for more

    25 dimensions”. I do not see any inflection, but I understand this

      <p>We have expanded the illustration, and now use the finite
      differences methods to identify the inflection point.</p>

    <p>The paper summarized the key challenges of inferring metawebs
    based on graph embedding approaches. It also highlighted the
    significant advantages of using graph embedding and transfer
    learning techniques for species interaction network prediction and
    other ecological problem applications. The paper provided a very
    important research direction of applying advanced graph embedding
    and transfer learning to tackle diverse inference tasks for species
    interaction networks.</p>

    <p>Fig.1 is a good diagram that shows the whole pipeline with the

    with transfer learning technique. I would also suggest the authors
    to include some experimental results based on graph embedding and
    transfer learning for specie interaction inference with real
    dataset.</p>
    <disp-quote>

    <title>General comments</title>
    <p>This manuscript consists in a revised version (re-submission) of
    a perspective paper dedicated to the potential contribution of graph
    embedding to metaweb prediction.</p>
    <p>The authors provided a pedagogical illustration on a
    host-parasites system, aiming at predicting (in a probabilistic way)
    the links of this bipartite network using Random Dot Product Graph
    embedding. This illustration implements key elements of Fig. 1 and
    might invite the reader to use or develop the embedding framework on
    various datasets. The figure showing the decrease of the loss with
    the rank of the embedding is particularly welcome since it shows to
    what extent network structure can be reasonably summarised in few
    dimensions using a specific embedding.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out that the
      rapid decrease in <inline-formula><alternatives>
      <tex-math><![CDATA[L_2]]></tex-math>
      <mml:math display="inline" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>
      loss is a good thing; we have added this information to the
      description of the case study, and further clarified this point by
      presenting the <inline-formula><alternatives>
      <tex-math><![CDATA[L_2]]></tex-math>
      <mml:math display="inline" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>
      loss (for interaction/pairwise level quality) and the cumulative
      variance explained (for network-level quality), as a pre-requisite
      for an ecological interpretation. We had to split the figure in
      two following further points by the reviewer, which resulted in
      new information in the figures and the text. We are extremely
      grateful for the improvement this resulted in.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>However, I got a bit surprised not to find the ecological
    interpretation of this embedding in terms of response and effects
    traits. I think the authors should better try to link ecological
    theory in general and ecological hypothesis associated with machine
    learning methods throughout the manuscript. I understand that the
    manuscript is centered on methods to predict metawebs with somehow
    incomplete sampling or knowledge. Consequently, as many research
    papers on applied machine learning in ecology, ecological hypothesis
    and theory are a bit behind the scene.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is a fair point, we thank the reviewer for bringing up
      this concern; we have added a paragraph to the section on
      embeddings, to explain why we do not think the values outputted by
      the models <italic>are</italic> traits. To summarize: they are not
      directly related, as causes or consequences, to organismal
      fitness. This does not prevent their use in predictive settings
      (indeed, we have clarified this at several places in the text,
      with examples), but it would be problematic to assume that they
      are “functional” traits. We think that <italic>latent
      values</italic> is a more appropriate descriptor, and is how we
      refer to them throughout the text.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>I think that a perspective paper should clarify possible
    ecological interpretation of machine learning methods. If the
    manuscript is clear and enlightening on the probabilistic metaweb
    approach, ecological hypothesis associated to link predictions are
    much more obscure. The following points should be somehow addressed
    in the manuscript to get additional perspectives:</p>
    <p>What are the interpretations of Random Dot Product Graph
    embeddings in terms of latent traits?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>In addition to the paragraph we added in response to the
      previous point, we have decided to split the illustration figure
      in two, in order to show how the position of species in the
      embedding sub-space relate to ecological information.
      Specifically, we extracted body mass information from PanTHERIA,
      and show that the position of hosts alongside the first (main)
      dimension of the embedding is predictive of parasite richness, but
      not of body mass; we also tie this result to existing literature.
      This is, in a way, a comforting result: there is information in
      the network that is not contained in body-mass, and approaches
      that can use both (such as embedding and transfer learning) are
      therefore likely to access <italic>more</italic> information about
      what makes interactions.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>What are the hypothesis behind link prediction using other
    information (traits, phylogeny as in Strydom et al 2022)?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for asking this important clarification;
      we have greatly expanded the section on the use of node metadata
      to clarify which hypotheses are associated to broad families of
      predictors, alongside references to published literature showing
      the importance of these predictors. We would like to point out
      that doing so goes beyond the scope of the previously published
      paper, and is a more general overview of ‘picking the right
      predictor for the right hypothesis’, up to and including
      hypothesis testing, as we now mention in the text. This is now
      additionally reflected in the conceptual figure, which separates
      ecologically relevant predictors from the rest of the latent
      variables used in the process, which should clarify what is an
      “ecological” data and what is created through the embedding
      process.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>What structures are considered in the different embeddings? Table
    1 mentions several embedding techniques and separates node from
    graph embedding. However, even two node embeddings algorithm can
    have different interpretations. For example, tsne is based on
    neighbor (local structure) whereas node2vec relies on random walks,
    so paths in the network (global structure). Both could be
    interpreted in ecological terms.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is an important clarification to request, and we thank the
      reviewer for bringing it up. The strength of embeddings is that
      they are robust to network structure <italic>and</italic> remove
      the need to know specific information about the network
      beforehand. We have added this information in the section on
      embeddings, but also discuss it (with new references to the
      literature) in the specific context of RDPG in the illustration.
      Some methods (RDPG among them) can preserve structures at
      different scales, perhaps giving some clues as to why they perform
      well on the few examples they have been tried on so far; this is
      speculation, and not part of the manuscript.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Predicting metawebs with these two methods do not hold the same
    hypothesis on species interactions. How does it affect potential
    applications? I think Table 1 must be enriched more (maybe add a
    figure or split it) in order to be a roadmap and not simply a
    catalog. It should mix and bridge embeddings, ecological
    interpretations and even some illustrations to guide the reader in
    this machine learning jungle. Such clarification should be also
    present in the manuscript</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have pointed out in the text, in a few places, that
      examining the “best” embedding method for a given problem is
      important; this is coming from existing literature. One issue with
      what the reviewer suggests is that the embedding techniques are
      not always easy to map onto ecological considerations. This is a
      good thing; indeed, this is because these techniques have been
      developed for general problems on graphs, and ecological networks
      are very likely to fall within the range of graphs that these
      methods will handle (in fact, this is demonstrated by the
      references in the table, specifically the column on applications).
      We think that one way this table can serve as a roadmap is by
      putting more emphasis on what has <italic>not</italic> been done,
      <italic>i.e.</italic> the majority of embedding techniques have
      not been applied to species interaction networks. We have updated
      the legend of the table to make this point stand out more, and
      given this argument a sub-section in this part of the
      manuscript.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>To what extent co-occurence data should be considered in
    embedding approaches? Co-occurence is considered for statistical
    association networks but probably not in the same manner than the
    deep learning model of (Strydom et al 2021). So, to what extent
    co-occurence data can be used to predict interaction? Table 1
    mentions statistical association methods and JSDM. The authors
    should be more clear in Table 1 and in the manuscript on the
    link/differences between association methods (that predicts
    associations from co-occurence) and link prediction using
    embeddings. The term statistical association is present in Table 1
    but not in the text, it can be quite confusing for the reader.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have clarified this point in the table, by explaining that
      some methods have been used for network-like problems, without
      being applied to species interaction data. Whether predicting
      co-occurrence qualifies as a network-like problem is a contentious
      point (and one we, mostly, disagree with), but the important point
      is that these methods can get data from node properties, and
      generate predictions that are, so to speak, network-shaped. We
      also touch upon the issue of co-occurrence in the illustration,
      and have added references highlighting why co-occurrence alone is
      not a good predictor to the introduction. Nevertheless, it
      <italic>can</italic> be added to the predictor data, and we have
      updated the conceptual figure in this way. When approaching this
      methodology from the perspective of different sources of
      information representing different hypotheses on what drives
      interactions, adding information on co-occurrence can help
      disentangle its role.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>I think this manuscript could be considered for publication in
    Methods in Ecology and Evolution but it must offer broader
    perspectives than Strydom et al. To do so, the authors should try to
    address somehow the previous listed points.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for their encouraging words, and for the
      suggestions that led to the revision of the illustration, and
      indeed most of the manuscript. We hope that the revised version
      will meet their expectations.</p>

    <p>L20: Local networks capture alpha-diversity of interactions but
    also beta diversity since interactions from the metaweb can be
    absent from local networks species absence.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is correct, but does not seem relevant to the paragraph;
      no changes were made as we are already past the word limit.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L24: Yes, I agree that Saravia et al. 2021 shows that local
    network structure (represented by network metrics blind to species
    identity) does not differ from the one expected from a null model
    (Trophic Theory of Island Food webs). However, the manuscript
    focuses on alpha-diversity metrics. In terms of species and
    interaction composition, they can still differ even if they have
    more or less the same structure. It think this point should be
    clarified. Indeed, otherwise, it somehow states that we do not need
    to focus on local composition since local networks have the same
    structure as the metaweb.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is correct, and we addressed this point in the original
      submission, in the next paragraph (which is focused on backbones
      of networks). No changes were made.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L63: Does it “generate” or uncover the core rules associated to
    species interactions? I do not really understand the point of
    “generating rules”. For me, statistical methods try, using abstract
    representations, to uncover/formulate biological rules.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is a good point, and we thank the reviewer for pointing it
      out. We have rephrased this sentence to clarify that observational
      data are used for the inference of rules, and that the resulting
      augmented dataset is used for analysis.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L79: Yes, embedding methods can exhibit structural invariants in
    ecological networks. However, what characteristics of the networks
    should be considered in the model (links,paths,motifs…)?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is an interesting point; we would like to apologize,
      first, for the lack of clarity, as we were talking about
      structural invariant in <italic>networks</italic>, not in their
      embeddings. We have clarified the paragraph. Second; the
      invariants in structure are not necessarily revealed by the usual
      network measures, but are indeed <italic>structural</italic>,
      <italic>i.e.</italic> they can be seen through the shape of the
      network. We have clarified the paragraph to make it clearer that
      the lower dimensions of an embedding should capture these
      invariants, and improved the transition to the work of Eklof et
      al. showing the low-dimensionality of food webs.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L83: If the choice of the embedding matters for the result, why
    not providing to the reader some sort of roadmap of these embeddings
    techniques for different applications?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>The literature suggests that the algorithm should be selected
      on a problem-specific basis, and we have changed the paragraph to
      reflect this. The table has been changed in response to other
      comments.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L85: For the moment, Table 1 is more a catalog than a
    roadmap.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is correct – we are unsure where the notion of a “roadmap”
      comes from, as we label the table an “overview”, and do not argue
      in the manuscript that the table can serve as a roadmap.
      Nevertheless, we are confident that there is value in the table as
      it is, as our survey of methods revealed that a number of them
      have not been used in network ecology; indeed, a number of
      references in the table are network-adjacent, as they describe the
      use of embeddings for JSDMs or statistical associations. In
      keeping with the response to the previous comment (the need for a
      case-by-base appraisal of embedding techniques), this is
      particularly problematic; we have edited the caption of the table
      to reflect this.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L86: Ok, here comes different network representations (latent
    traits or random walks). How do we interpret these methods in
    ecological terms? Which one is the most suitable in the various
    potential applications.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>As we have mentioned in other places in the manuscript, this is
      context-dependent, and existing literature suggests that one
      should explore different embedding techniques.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L99: Bohan et al. 2017 mentions several associations methods to
    build networks. If I am correct, these associations methods are not
    mentioned in the manuscript. The authors must clarify this
    point.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>The methods in Bohan et al. are not based on embedding (and
      deal with specific categories of datasets that are far from
      widespread anyways); we have not edited the manuscript here.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L115: The authors should clarify the ecological hypothesis
    associated to such approach and the potential limits of predicting
    interactions using node metadata.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have expanded this paragraph significantly, by explicitly
      stating what the assumptions in using these predictors are, and
      further by showing how the relationship between phylogeny/traits
      and embeddings can be used in the context of testing hypotheses
      about the drivers of the structure of networks.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L134: I think this illustration is relevant but it must be
    enriched in order, for example, to compare different embedding or
    incorporating meta-data. To what extent will different embedding
    techniques provide different networks? Will the loss with the rank
    be similar if you use link (as in the RDGP model) or path based
    embedding?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have greatly expanded the illustration, notably to bring
      into consideration more ecological elements. The potential to
      perform the analysis that the reviewer suggests is limited by data
      availability, and would be outside the scope of this
      manuscript.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Moreover, Stochastic Block Model can also but used to perform
    link predictions (Gaucher et al. 2019; Link Prediction in the
    Stochastic Block Model with Outliers. stat.) and is related to RDGP,
    I think it deserves a mention here.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have added a discussion of this article in the section on
      metawebs; an importantly feature of embeddings is that they do not
      assume a specific structure for the network in order to capture
      emergent features.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L136: What are the ecological hypothesis associated to RDGP model
    in terms of response and effect traits?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have addressed this comment by adding a paragraph about the
      status of latent values w.r.t. response/effect traits, which we
      can summarize as “the latent values should not be discussed as
      functional traits”. Furthermore, we have added a justification of
      why RDPG is an interesting embedding technique in the first
      paragraph of the section on the illustration.</p>

  <title>Senior Editor Comments to Authors</title>
  <p>This MS is strongly linked to the recently published one in MEE
  since it was split from this published one early on. While the links
  between the 2 obvious, the present MS should be more clearly
  independent from the other since the overall perspective of the
  reviews is that the ms adds little to the previous published
  paper.</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p>We would like to express our surprise regarding this comment,
    since the other article was only mentioned twice (in the caption of
    a figure and in a table). In order to address specific comments by
    the first reviewer, we actually had to cite this manuscript in a few
    more places. We also want to point out that the submitted version of
    this present manuscript includes (i) an overview of embedding
    techniques and their application to species interaction networks,
    (ii) a discussion of the properties of metawebs that make them
    amenable to prediction through embeddings, and (iii) a discussion of
    the remaining technical and methodological challenges associated
    with this approach; therefore, we strongly feel like the comments
    about this manuscript adding little, as all of the aforementioned
    elements are absent from the previous manuscript, are unfair.
    Specifically, our initial introduction contained the following
    statement for this manuscript: “In this contribution, we highlight
    the power in viewing (and constructing) metawebs as
    <italic>probabilistic</italic> objects in the context of rare
    interactions, discuss how a family of machine learning tools (graph
    embeddings and transfer learning) can be used to overcome data
    limitations to metaweb inference, and highlight how the use of
    metawebs introduces important questions for the field of network
    ecology”.</p>
    <p>To be perfectly transparent about our feelings reading the
    review, we did feel like our manuscript was reviewed with the
    mindest that it was presented as a Research (and not Perspective)
    article. We followed the MEE guidelines about Perspective articles,
    <italic>i.e.</italic> “to stimulate scientific debate, [by offering]
    conceptual advances or opinions or identity gaps in knowledge”,
    which is a different type of work than a complete methodological
    treatment of the topic, or a narrative Review of it.</p>
    <p>We also, notably in response to the comments made by the second
    reviewer, had to defend ourselves against accusations of
    sensationalism (“marketing”), opportunism, speculation, and general
    sloppyness. Although we did not assume that this reviewer was acting
    entirely in bad faith, we hope that the senior editor will
    understand that we had to take a lot of critical distance from these
    comments. We did bring specific responses to how a significant
    numbers of them were unfair, unsubstantiated, or unprofessional, but
    have nevertheless done our best to respond to them fairly; this is
    more than the courtesy extended to us by the second reviewer. It is
    concerning to receive reviews of this nature; not only do they
    establish the wrong example by throwing around unfounded accusations
    of low professional standards, they have a lasting impact on the
    perception of early career scientists, of which this manuscript has
    many. We do politely request that the senior editor, should this
    manuscript be sent for review again, does not asks the second
    reviewer for their advice.</p>
  </disp-quote>
  <p>In summary, they should be complementary but not overlapping to a
  large extent. In the current ms, a strong message yet different from
  the other paper would be that graph embedding is an emerging field in
  machine learning that holds great potential for ecological problems.
  And this will certainly affect the whole structure of the ms.</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p>We do appreciate this comment, and wholeheartedly agree. Yet, it
    is extremely difficult for us to address, as to the best of our
    understanding of the two reviews and the senior editor comments,
    there is not a single instance where areas of overlap are clearly
    identified, or indeed identified <italic>at all</italic>. Following
    the comments of reviewer 1, we do hope that the central argument
    (“graph embedding is useful for link prediction”) will be clearer,
    but in the absence of specific substantiated comments about what
    constitutes overlap, we have not made significant alterations to the
    manuscript.</p>
  </disp-quote>
  <p>Adding a section on “how to” approach graph embedding, and a
  nutshell section on embedding methods vs dimension reduction method,
  an example dataset to assess with a R-code; all these would be
  essential for the ms even if it coud go over the word limit. Overall,
  if these comments are implement together with the suggestions of the
  reviewers, the current ms would be completely revamped and would need
  a lot of work from the authors. yet it should produce a strong ms and
  have potential to influence the field.</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p>We have added this section after the overview of techniques, and
    we now distribute the code to perform the analysis as Supplementary
    Material. This resulted in an additional figure, outlining a number
    of information that can be extracted from an embedding of a
    metaweb.</p>

    <title>General comments</title>
    <p>I read this interesting text about the idea of using embeddings
    to predict metawebs. I understand that this is a perspective. About
    2/3 of the manuscript is dealing with metawebs (very pleasant to
    read), and the remaining 1/3 recommend the use of network embeddings
    (actually, the authors have mixed up embedding methods and dimension
    reduction methods, which are actually two disjoint but connected
    concepts).</p>
    <p>However, I am very suprised that there is no material to support
    the proposal. Do the authors already use an embedding techniques on
    their datasets? They claim it is promising to use embedding with
    metawebs, but is it an intuition? or are there scientifical
    experiments/analysis/reasoning that could support this idea?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is a surprising comment. The table in the original
      manuscript already had a list of embeddings methods applied to
      species interactions predictions, which in our opinion should
      assuage the concern of reviewer 1 by establishing that this is not
      “an intuition”. Indeed, table 1 has a number of empty cases in the
      last column, which not only outlines what has been done, but what
      methods are available for application to species interactions.
      Furthermore, a part of the text discusses recent work from Strydom
      et al. (2022) wherein graph embeddings have been used to not only
      predict a metaweb, but do so by transferring information across
      space. Despite the fact that these information was already in the
      original manuscript, we have re-worded and expanded a number of
      sections to make them stand out more.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>At some point, I am wondering if it would be have been possible
    to write the same article replacing “embedding” by “graph neural
    networks”… These are all interesting techniques, and I do appreciate
    that the authors try to help ecologists to understand them. But we
    need more facts to understand the pros/cons of these options. I am
    afraid the reader can not be convinced reading the manuscript in its
    present form.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is a good question, which we explored during the writing
      of the initially submitted manuscript. GNN approaches are
      comparatively younger than the broader family of graph embeddings
      methods. We have added a rationale for not spending too much time
      on GNN (which would also require to introduce a solid amount of
      literature on deep learning in general), but point readers towards
      recent reviews. In order to help convince the reader, we are
      confident that the addition of an illustration or embedding on
      empirical data, alongside the discussion of already published
      studies, will help. Furthermore, we have revised the last section
      to bring more concrete suggestions of required work, which will
      hopefully stimulate further analyses.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>I am sincerely annoyed that I can’t be more positive, maybe I
    missed something, and I hope that these comments can be used to
    improve the manuscript. But I do think this paper is “too light” to
    be published in MEE.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We hope that our gentle reminder of the nature of this
      (Perspective) paper as given in the response to the Senior Editor,
      will help assuage the sentiment that the paper is too “light”; it
      is not expected to be a formal comparative analysis of the
      methods, not is it expected to be an exhaustive narrative review.
      Indeed, we point out that these approaches are novel for the
      prediction of species interactions, and our hope with this
      manuscript is that more community ecologists will attempt to use
      them in the future. We are confident that the additions to the
      text are addressing all major comments raised by reviewer 1.</p>

    <p>Until l.68: a very nice introduction about the concept of

      <p>Thank you.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L.72-83 &amp; Table 1 : here, there is a mixture of graph and
    node embeddings, i.e. projecting a graph or a node into a low
    dimensional space. Would require some clarifications.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>The second column of the table already specifies (explicitly)
      whether nodes or graphs (as well as sub-graphs, multiple graphs,
      and node complexes) are embedded given the different methods; we
      are not sure what the reviewer wants to see added as a
      clarification. As the information asked is already given, and in
      the absence of specific feedback, we have not changed the
      manuscript (besides splitting the table to separate the type of
      embedded object and the embedding method).</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L.91 &amp; Figure 2 : there is another subtlety here. Indeed,
    embedding is often followed by a dimension reduction technique
    (could be PCA, t-SNE). As in figure 2, section D is for dimension
    reduction. In my opinion, these are two distinct concepts, embedding
    and dimension reduction. For instance, one can perform an embedding
    listing a series of metrics, then perform a PCA to obtain a 2-D
    representation.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This is indeed a subtle point, and very respectfully, we think
      that the reviewer’s confusion justifies the need for our
      manuscript. Graph embedding and dimensionality reduction are
      different yet <italic>related</italic> concepts. For example, PCA
      can be used initially to maximise the information in a dataset
      then fed into t-SNE; both the PCA and t-SNE step can be
      parameterized to retain fewer dimensions, but so can neither of
      them, with the user deciding to visualize a two or three
      dimensional representation. We have added a paragraph to make sure
      this point is extremely clear, and we hope that it will help
      readers decide on the appropriate method to use. As a sidenote
      (and not discussed in the manuscript), measuring network
      properties and performing a PCA on those (although common in
      network ecology) is not an embedding on the network, and is
      therefore not discussed here for the sake of text length.</p>

    <p>L. 128-141: this part is interesting at some point, but the
    reader can loose the point of the article… In particular, mentioning
    AI here is disconnected to the remaining text. I understand that
    embedding methods are part of AI at some point, but AI gather so
    many domains….</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have considerably expanded the last section, to further
      clarify which issues were “research-based” <italic>v.</italic>
      “praxis-based” problems, alongside possible avenues to start
      adressing these problems. We do hope that this will make the point
      of the last paragraph more obvious.</p>

    <title>General comments</title>
    <p>This manuscript consists in a perspective on the use of graph
    embeddings to infer potential interactions, by using metadata and
    interaction databases. It is, somehow, linked to the idea that
    potential interactions involving a new species can be predicted from
    its traits (vulnerability and foraging) and interactions involving
    similar species. If such an idea , based on niche conservatism
    regarding interactions, is not new (e.g. Desjardins-Proulx et al.
    2017, Strydom et al. 2021a), the use of graph embeddings to infer
    potential interactions is a useful step forward.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We agree with this comment; graph embeddings can indeed project
      networks in a space where the detection of unknown interactions is
      easier, and we support this claim with several examples throughout
      the text. No changes requested (none made).</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>However, I strongly doubt that such a short and speculative paper
    helps the network ecology community.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We have no choice but to very firmly push back on the idea that
      the manuscript is speculative. The manuscript is prospective, or
      forward-looking, but every claim we make is either backed by facts
      (in the forms of references to existing literature in the fields
      of ecology, machine learning, and environmental governance), or
      accompanied (notably in the last section) by suggestions of
      additional work needed to address some of the gaps we have
      identified. “Speculative” is an unfair assessment of our work, and
      we do hope that it did not affect the reviewer ability to take it
      seriously. We would like to point out that despite this sweeping
      (and serious) accusation, the reviewer is unable to point to a
      specific instance of a speculative claim.</p>
      <p>We furthermore point out that table 1 contains examples of
      published research using the techniques we discuss, and that the
      text contains discussion of some of these papers. We are therefore
      confident that we clear the bar for the manuscript not being
      “speculative” by a very large margin.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Despite being appealing (it mentions the term ‘machine learning’
    10 times), I think that it contains too much generic wishful
    thinking to be useful and implementable.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We would like to question the intent behind this comment. Is
      there a threshold above which mentioning machine learning too much
      opens authors to accusations of “generic wishful thinking”? Should
      a paper specifically about a field of machine learning
      <italic>not</italic> call the field by its name? Would a
      predictive method by any other name predict just as well?</p>
      <p>We also would like to point out that the doubt expressed by the
      reviewer about the ability to implement these methods is directly
      addressed by Table 1 and the main text, in which we discuss
      examples of research papers using these exact methods for the
      prediction of species interactions. We are concerned that this
      comment, besides its inappropriate amount of sarcasm, reflects a
      bad faith reading of our manuscript.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>In other words, I would expect less marketing and much more
    science for a paper in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We do not feel like such a cheap accusation, without any
      argument to back it up, warrants a response. Again, the reviewer
      is comfortable making sweeping statements about “marketing”
      without seemingly being able to identify a single instance that
      has too much marketing, or too little science.</p>
      <p>We would expect less aggresive snark and much more constructive
      criticism for a review in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>Moreover, the main idea of the paper (using node metadata to
    predict new interactions using nodes embedding) comes from a paper
    of the same authors that is not peer-reviewed and I feel a bit
    uncomfortable with that (see Strydom et al. 2021b)</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This statement – in addition to being arguably incorrect – is
      no longer relevant as the version of the preprint we cited has now
      been published. We do hope that this brings reviewer 2
      comfort.</p>

    <title>Detailed comments</title>
    <p>L51: this sentence is a tautological, if interactions are
    represented by parameter of bernoulli law, there are already
    weighted appropriately</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>No changes were made - the interactions are weighed
      appropriately compared to the binary baseline, as is the point of
      the sentence.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L62: ‘machine learning algortihms’ : fancy term but not very
    specific. What algorithms are you talking about ?</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>The paper cited at the end of this sentence primarily uses
      artificial neural networks, but concludes on the potential to use
      “data-driven techniques”, which feels neither less nor more
      specific than our reference to “ML algorithms”; as we do spell out
      in the sentence immediately after this one, the core point is that
      ML algorithms that can be made to generate data have the potential
      to augment data collected through empirical means. No changes made
      to the manuscript.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L78: Botella et al. 2022 does not use node embeddings but network
    embeddings. In this case, each point of the low dimension space is a
    network and not a node. Consequently, it won’t be useful to predict
    new potential links. Table 1 is mixing nodes and network embeddings
    that do answer to different ecological questions.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>The fact that Table 1 lists different types of embeddings is
      self-evident from the second column of table 1, which is
      specifically about the type of objects being embedded. No changes
      made to the manuscript.</p>
      <p>Concerning the Botella et al. 2022 paper, the reviewer is
      indeed correct that they use graph embedding. We do agree with
      this interpretation. In fact, nowhere do we argue that their
      results are relevant to interaction prediction, and instead we
      summarize the findings of this article: there is a need to
      evaluate multiple embeddings for each problem, as their
      performance may differ.</p>
      <p>All the information required was already in the manuscript, no
      changes were made.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L84: This sentence is too generic. What are machine learning
    techniques here ? If you include node embedding in it, it deals with
    discrete data. Moreover, there is a broad network science
    litterature that deals with discrete data.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>The techniques we discuss are listed in the reference given
      immediately at the end of the sentence. There is indeed literature
      on discrete data (we do not make claims to the contrary); our
      point remains that projecting discrete data into a dense,
      continuous space comes with a list of benefits (that are listed in
      the remainder of this paragraph, together with references to the
      relevant literature). No changes were made.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L129: This sounds a bit superficial and opportunistic. I don’t
    think such a serious topic can be adequately covered in a short
    paragraph. Yes, we all know that machine learning techniques will
    save the world, thanks.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We would like to question whether this dismisiveness of our
      work is contributing in a positive way to the discussion that is
      supposed to take place as part of the review process, and whether
      this is the behavior the second reviewer thinks should be
      demonstrated to early career authors.</p>
      <p>To be candid, the comments by reviewer 2 mostly come across as
      opposed to our work as a matter of principle, but (more
      concerningly) as refusing to take it seriously, by chosing to
      expres a concerning number of points through sarcasm rather than
      in a professional voice more becoming of the review process.</p>
      <p>We did our best in our response to the specific points below to
      not reciprocate, and explained why changes were (or were not)
      made, but we cannot weigh this review equally to the constructive
      comments made by the first reviewer. “Superficial”, but mostly
      “opportunistic”, are egregious attacks on our profesionalism, and
      insinuate that we did not write the manuscript in good faith. They
      do not deserve a reply, for they should never have been
      written.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>More seriously, we should not forget that these techniques are
    built by people and not machines. Consequently, they are also
    subjects to cultural/national biases since influencing academic
    centers are located in the western world.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We do agree with the reviewer, and this is, in fact, a core
      point of the paragraph, and of most of the articles cited therein.
      As the reviewer and authors are in agreement, no changes were
      made.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L135: I doubt that ‘algorithmic thinking’ is generating new
    knowledge thanks to machine learning. Actually, ecological knowledge
    is generated by people, not machines. Of course, statistical
    techniques help scientists to analyze and structure data. But they
    must remain tools in the hands of individuals.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>We do agree with the reviewer (but would like to point out that
      the definition of algorithmic thinking we use comes from the
      article cited immediately before we first mention “algorithmic
      thinking”). We have added a reference to “algorithm in the loop”
      approaches (in other fields, as this notion has been
      under-explored in ecological sciences), alongside their possible
      issues, and suggestions as to what the next steps are.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L140: But it should also be recognized that these tools, because
    they can be difficult to understand for non-specialists, can pose
    problems of interpretation. Moreover, they can make those who make
    decisions dependent on a tool that they do not master.</p>
    <disp-quote>
      <p>This has been adressed as part of the previous comment, by
      emphasizing the need for training and computational literacy in
      decision makers.</p>
    </disp-quote>
    <p>L145 : Long acknowledgements section for a short paper !</p>

      <p>We refuse to engage with this comment.</p>
